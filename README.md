#Bank App
<hr>

## About Project
This is a simple Java application that simulates bank transactions.

It was developed as part of Qu√©bec Java Digital Bootcamp from [Digital Innovation One (DIO)](https://web.dio.me) as a revision of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

The principles of OOP explored in this application are:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Composition & delegation
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

The application is able to represent entities involved in a bank service, such as client, bank, accounts of different types and perform simple transactions between accounts, such as deposit, withdraw and transfer between accounts.

## Technologies used
